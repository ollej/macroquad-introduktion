# The end

![Ferris the teacher](images/ferris-teacher-small.png)

You have now developed and published a simple game written in the programming
language Rust and the game library Macroquad. However there is still a lot to
be done to make it into a complete game, but you should now have a solid
foundation to make the game into your own.

Here are some ideas on how to improve the game to make it more fun to play:

* Add more enemies with different movements and graphics.
* Allow enemies to shoot bullets or drop bombs themselves.
* Make enemies show up in waves instead of just randomly.
* Add levels with increasing difficulty.
* Upgrades that improve the weapon or add different types of weapons.
* Add big boss enemies at the end of levels.
* Extra lives.
* Add health and display a health bar.
* Add an upgrade with shield around the spaceship.
* Store the top ten scores and add a highscore screen.
* Use [macroquad-tiled](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/tree/master/tiled) to make a level with graphical background.
* Add a shop between levels to buy upgrades.
* Make the spaceship invulnerable and blinking for a short while after resurrection.
* Look at the Macroquad [post processing](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/blob/master/examples/post_processing.rs) example on how to add a CRT shader.
* Use the font from the [graphical menu chapter](ch13-menu-ui.md) for all texts in the game.
* Show a victory sequence at the end of each level.
* Support two simultaneous players.
