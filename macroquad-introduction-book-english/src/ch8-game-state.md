Before we add any more functionality to our game it's time for some
refactoring. To make it easier to keep track of the game state we'll add an
enum called `GameState` with variants to differentiate between the game being
played and the game being over. This will allows us to remove the `gameover`
variable, and we can add states for showing a start menu and pausing the game.

## Implementation

### Game state enum

Begin by adding an enum called `GameState` below the `Shape` implementation.
It should contain all four possible game states: `MainMenu`, `Playing`,
`Paused`, and `GameOver`.

```rust
{{#include ../../my-game/examples/game-state.rs:stateenum}}
```

### Game state variable

Replace the line that declares the `gameover` variable with a line that
instantiates a `game_state` variable set to `GameState::MainMenu`.

```rust
{{#include ../../my-game/examples/game-state.rs:statevariable}}
```

### Match on GameState

We'll replace the old code in the game loop with code that uses the `match`
control flow construct on the `game_state` variable. It has to match on all
four states in the enum. Later on we'll add back code from the earlier chapter
within the matching arms. Keep the call to clearing the screen at the start of
the loop, and the call to `next_frame().await` at the end.

```rust [hl,3-16]
        clear_background(DARKPURPLE);

        match game_state {
            GameState::MainMenu => {
                ...
            }
            GameState::Playing => {
                ...
            }
            GameState::Paused => {
                ...
            }
            GameState::GameOver => {
                ...
            }
        }

        next_frame().await
```

### Main menu

Now let's add back code into the match arms to handle each game state. When
the game is started, the state will be `GameState::MainMenu`. We'll start by
quitting the game if the `Escape` key is pressed. If the player presses the
space key we'll set the `game_state` to the new state `GameState::Playing`.
We'll also reset all the game variables. We will also draw the text "Press
space" in the middle of the screen.

```rust
{{#include ../../my-game/examples/game-state.rs:mainmenu}}
```

### Playing the game

Let's add back the code for playing the game to the matching arm for the state
`GameState::Playing`. It's the same code as most of the game loop from the
last chapter. However, don't add back the code that handles Game Over as it
will be added in the matching arm for the `GameState::GameOver`.

We'll also add a code that checks if the player presses the `Escape` key and
change the state to `GameState::Paused`. This will ensure that the game will
be paused in the next iteration of the game loop.

```rust [hl,1,24-26,65,108]
{{#include ../../my-game/examples/game-state.rs:playing}}
```

### Pause the game

Many games have the option to pause the action, so we'll add support for that
in our game, too. When the game is paused, we'll check if the player presses
the `Space` key and change the game state to `GameState::Playing` so that the
game can continue. We'll also draw a text on the screen showing that the game
is paused.

The changed game state will only come into effect in the next iteration of the
game loop, so even if it has been changed we need to display the text during
the current frame.

```rust
{{#include ../../my-game/examples/game-state.rs:paused}}
```

### Game Over

Finally we will handle what happens when the game is over. If the player
presses the space bar we'll change the state to `GameState::MainMenu` to allow
the player to start a new game or quit the game. We'll also draw the "GAME
OVER!" text to the screen as we did in the last chapter.

```rust
{{#include ../../my-game/examples/game-state.rs:gameover}}
```

```admonish note title="Separate game states"
Since the states for `GameState::Playing` and `GameState::GameOver` are
separated, the squares and circles will not be shown when the game is paused.
```

```admonish tip title="Challenge: Name of the game" class="challenge"
Now that we have a main menu, you could come up with a name for your game and
display it in a large font at the top of the screen in the state
`GameState::MainMenu`.

You could also try drawing all the circles and squares even when the game is
paused without moving them.
